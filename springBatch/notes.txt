SpringBatch is usefull for executing series of jobs.
Each job has many steps.
Each steps does "READ-PROCESS-WRITE". Each step is called a task (tasklet)
Job = (step1 => step2 => step3).

In spring, we can specify sequence of steps in an xml file. This information is stored in database, so in case of failure, 
spring batching will start from where it failed instead of starting from the begining.
